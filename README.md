## Retro Games

This project was made by a second year university student as a summer project. 

## Introduction

This project is a Retro games app where you are able to play three classic games: Snake, Pong & Tetris. The user is also capable of creating an account, which gives the benefit of storing the users high score on Firebase and from there show it in the leaderboard

## Inside the app

When the app is launched the first thing the user sees is Snake. By swiping left or right the user can switch their view and see the different pages. The pages go in this order: Snake, Pong, Tetris, Leaderboard.

If the player loses a "Losing" screen will appear where it shows the users score from the just lost game and it also shows the user their high score.
